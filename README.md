## About
`Twileloop.SST` is a lightweight implementation of a single-source-of-truth concept. 

This package allows you to store your application state (data required for running your app / keeping a session) centrally in memory as a singleton instance and surround it with state management functions.
Once a state is stored, Your app should stick to this state (single-source-of-truth), Allowing you to make the app respond predictably as the state changes.

<hr/>

You can modify this state from anywhere in your app,

Get callbacks when your state changes, see state update history, diff 2 states, or even implement time travel with state undo & redo.
